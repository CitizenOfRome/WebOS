They wanted to see revenue estimates and possible cash flow scenarios.
It costs much less in terms of time and money to get it right at the beginning than trying to sort it out later.

I overexecuted the competition.
I was looking to build relationships that lasted.
The size of the account really didn’t matter. What mattered was the way I handled it.
deliver more than you promised & more than they expect
Never relax. Never rest on your laurels.
I had to be better than the rest of them.

Key Performance Indicators: reviewing a checklist—all the things I needed to do to keep the business running smoothly.
Then I would look at the daily revenue reports and at the forecasts for the day, the week, the month, and the quarter
I’d spend a little time looking at what my competitors were up to (new clients, announcements, etc.).

A company that looks good and sounds good inspires confidence.
The more information you have, the more likely you are to hit your target.
If I became complacent—if I let my guard down for even a moment—the results could be disastrous.
Never lose sight of the competition.
I would check their Web sites religiously to see what they were up to.
I made lists of companies whose business I was after and figured out how I might approach them.
important for me to be my own boss, to run my own show.
I was cautious to a fault.
Stereotypes make people comfortable.

*Peter Thiel's BUBBLE: Instead, for Thiel, the bubble that has taken the place of housing is the higher education bubble. “A true bubble is when something is overvalued and intensely believed,” he says. “Education may be the only thing people still believe in in the United States. To question education is really dangerous. It is the absolute taboo. It’s like telling the world there’s no Santa Claus.” ... Like any good bubble, this belief– while rooted in truth– gets pushed to unhealthy levels. Thiel talks about consumption masquerading as investment during the housing bubble, as people would take out speculative interest-only loans to get a bigger house with a pool and tell themselves they were being frugal and saving for retirement. ... But Thiel’s issues with education run even deeper. He thinks it’s fundamentally wrong for a society to pin people’s best hope for a better life on  something that is by definition exclusionary. “If Harvard were really the best education, if it makes that much of a difference, why not franchise it so more people can attend? Why not create 100 Harvard affiliates?” he says. “It’s something about the scarcity and the status. In education your value depends on other people failing. Whenever Darwinism is invoked it’s usually a justification for doing something mean. It’s a way to ignore that people are falling through the cracks, because you pretend that if they could just go to Harvard, they’d be fine. Maybe that’s not true.”
Gavan Woolery · Top Commenter · CTO at Appstem Media LLC -- I think there is actually a very good reason for this. People from Ivy League schools make the best slaves - they have perfected the art of following instructions from other people.
David Carter · Charlotte, North Carolina --- Yea good idea on selection because working from the top to bottom has been working out so well for the majority of Americans.
